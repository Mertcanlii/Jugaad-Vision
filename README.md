# Autonomous Vehicle Project
# Welcome to the Autonomous Vehicle Project! This is a volunteer project that aims to develop an autonomous vehicle using a combination of software, mechanical, and electrical expertise.

# About the Project
# Our goal is to create a fully autonomous vehicle that can navigate safely and efficiently in various environments, such as roads, highways, and urban areas. We believe that autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry and improve road safety while reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions.

# To achieve our goal, we have formed a project team that consists of software engineers, mechanical engineers, and electrical engineers. Each team is responsible for developing and testing different aspects of the autonomous vehicle, including the software algorithms, the hardware components, and the sensors.

# How to Contribute
# We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in the project, regardless of their background or skill level. If you would like to contribute, please read our contribution guidelines here(eklenecek).

# Current Progress
# We have made significant progress in developing the software algorithms and the mechanical components of the autonomous vehicle. Our current focus is on integrating these components and testing the vehicle in a simulated environment before moving on to real-world testing.

# Contact Us
# If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to contact us at (canli.mert.mc@gmail.com). We would love to hear from you and collaborate with you to create a safer, more sustainable future with autonomous vehicles.
